# Password Manager

A simple and secure password manager built with Python. It allows you to store, retrieve, update, and delete passwords for various services securely. Additionally, it includes features for password generation and strength checking.

## Features

- Add Password: Store a new password for a service.
- Retrieve Password: Retrieve the username and password for a stored service.
- Update Password: Update the password for an existing service.
- Delete Password: Delete the password for a stored service.
- Generate Password: Generate a strong random password.
- Check Password Strength: Check the strength of a given password.

## Technologies Used

- Python: The main programming language.
- bcrypt: For hashing passwords.
- cryptography: For encrypting and decrypting stored passwords.
- colorama: For colored terminal output.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/NamX1/Password-Manager.git
   cd Password-Manager
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows:
     ```sh
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS and Linux:
     ```sh
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. Install the required packages:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the main program:
   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```

2. Follow the prompts in the terminal to interact with the password manager.

## Security

- Master Password: The program uses a master password to secure your stored passwords. Make sure to remember it as it is required to access the manager.
- Encryption: Passwords are encrypted using the `cryptography` library before being stored.
- Hashing: The master password is hashed using `bcrypt` to ensure security.
